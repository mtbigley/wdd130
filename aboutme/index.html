    <p>Hey everyone, I'm Michael. Initially I was a mechanical engineering major, but switched over to computer science because I felt more at home with computers than I did engineering. 
        I hope to one day end up in the Aerospace industry, but who knows where the world of computer science will take me! As for interests, I have too many. I'm an avid reader, 
        a water sports enthusiast, an astronomy geek, a gamer, an archery geek, a dabbler in poetry, and many other things. </p>
        <p>I married the love of my life, Savannah, 2 years ago, and have one four-month-old daughter who grows bigger, louder and happier each day. In the past I would take any job
        that paid the bills, but I hope to go into machine-learning and apply what I learn to the Aerospace industry. 
        What I love most about BYUI is how supportive it is. If you need help, advice or even just friends, the faculty and church have thought of everything. I'm currently pursuing
        a Bachelor's in computer science, with a minor in Mechanical Engineering. Might as well put those credits to use since I have them right?
        The internet permeates most societies from the ground up, and is ubiquitous in the lives of just about all modern day global citizens. Learning about careers in web design is
        not only wildy beneficial for understanding how our world functions, but also opens an entire world of jobs and career options based around working on, in or through the 
        world-wide web. </p>
        <p>The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints is a community I've had the privelege to be a part of since birth thanks to two faithful parents. My mother, a lifetime member
        from Samoa, and my father, a Lutheran convert from Washington state. If I had to choose a quote from a church leader, it would be from Thomas S. Monson. 
        'A man (or woman) without a purpose, is like a ship without a rudder.' My favorite scripture would have to be Philippians 4:13. 'I can do all things through Him who
        strengthens me.'
